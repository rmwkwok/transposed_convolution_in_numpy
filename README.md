This is an implementation of the normal convolution and the transposed convolution in Numpy. [I have explained the work in details in this medium article.](https://medium.com/@rmwkwok/explain-implement-and-compare-2d-transposed-convolution-in-numpy-tensorflow-and-pytorch-2068d986ec5) The `main.ipynb` file shows some comparisons with Tensorflow and Pytorch, and those tests can be found in `tests.py` which can be a guide for using the numpy implementation for your work. All components of the convolutions are covered in the `conv2d_transpose_numpy.py` file.

Thank you for your interest!
